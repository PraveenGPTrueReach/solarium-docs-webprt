<h1>Test Data Cleanup Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The k6 test data cleanup utility removes test entities created during performance testing to prevent data pollution in staging environments.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Basic Cleanup</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Run cleanup
npm run k6:cleanup

# Preview cleanup (dry-run)
npm run k6:cleanup:dry-run

# Show cleanup statistics
npm run k6:cleanup:stats

Advanced Options
# Custom concurrency (default: 5)
node scripts/k6-cleanup.js --concurrency=10

# Custom batch size (default: 50)
node scripts/k6-cleanup.js --batch-size=100

# Dry run mode
node scripts/k6-cleanup.js --dry-run

Test Entity Identification
Prefixes Cleaned
  k6-test-* - General test entities
  k6-baseline-* - Baseline test entities
  k6-stress-* - Stress test entities
  k6-soak-* - Soak test entities
  k6-soak600-* - 600 VU soak test entities
Customer Names
  K6 Test Customer*
  K6 Stress Customer*
  K6 Soak Customer*
Notes Content
  Any notes containing test prefixes

Entity Types Cleaned
Leads
  Action: Archive (set status to &#39;Archived&#39;)
  Fallback: Delete if archiving fails
  API: PATCH /api/v1/leads/{id} or DELETE /api/v1/leads/{id}
Quotations
  Action: Archive (set status to &#39;Archived&#39;)
  Fallback: Delete if archiving fails
  API: PATCH /api/v1/quotations/{id} or DELETE /api/v1/quotations/{id}
Customers
  Action: Archive (set status to &#39;Archived&#39;)
  Fallback: No deletion (usually not allowed)
  API: PATCH /api/v1/customers/{id}
Configuration
Environment Variables
  K6_BASE_URL=https://staging-api.solarium.com
  K6_ADMIN_USER=admin_cleanup_user
  K6_ADMIN_PASS=admin_cleanup_password
Default Settings
  Concurrency: 5 simultaneous operations
  Batch Size: 50 entities per discovery batch
  Retry Attempts: 3 with exponential backoff
  Retry Delay: 1 second base delay

CI/CD Integration

Automatic Cleanup
Cleanup runs automatically after each CI test:
  After baseline tests
  After stress tests
  After soak tests
  After monthly soak tests

Manual Cleanup
# Trigger cleanup in CI
gh workflow run load-test.yml --field test_type=health
# Cleanup runs automatically after test completion

Safety Features
Dry Run Mode

npm run k6:cleanup:dry-run
  Previews what would be cleaned
  No actual changes made
  Safe for auditing

Error Handling
  Continues on individual failures
  Logs all errors with entity details
  Provides comprehensive statistics
  Never fails the entire CI build
Concurrency Limits
  Prevents server overload
  Configurable based on API capacity
  Default of 5 concurrent operations

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Authentication Failures
# Check credentials
echo $K6_ADMIN_USER
echo $K6_ADMIN_PASS

# Test authentication manually
curl -X POST https://staging-api.solarium.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#39;{&quot;email&quot;:&quot;&#39;$K6_ADMIN_USER&#39;&quot;,&quot;password&quot;:&quot;&#39;$K6_ADMIN_PASS&#39;&quot;}&#39;

High Failure Rates
# Reduce concurrency
node scripts/k6-cleanup.js --concurrency=2

# Check server capacity
# Review API rate limits

Permission Errors
# Verify admin user has delete/archive permissions
# Check API endpoint availability
# Review server logs for detailed errors

Debug Mode
# Enable verbose logging
DEBUG=cleanup:* node scripts/k6-cleanup.js --dry-run

Best Practices
Regular Cleanup
  Run after each test execution
  Monitor cleanup success rates
  Review failed entities periodically
Staging Environment
  Always test cleanup in staging first
  Never run against production
  Verify admin credentials are staging-only
Performance
  Adjust concurrency based on API capacity
  Use appropriate batch sizes
  Monitor server resources during cleanup
Data Safety
  Always use dry-run for new environments
  Backup important data before bulk cleanup
  Verify test entity identification logic

Maintenance
Weekly Tasks
  Review cleanup statistics
  Check for failed entities
  Verify test prefixes are current
Monthly Tasks
  Update test prefixes if needed
  Review cleanup performance
  Validate admin credentials rotation
